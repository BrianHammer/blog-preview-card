## Overview

A blog UI component made with Tailwind.

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](TO_BE_ADDED)

## My process

Built with tailwind. I put many of the colors layed out in the style-guide inside tailwind.config. Set the 'content' setting to the ./index.html path. Whenever edits need to be made, I run the following command:

``` npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./output.css --watch ```

I view my edits using live server.

### Built with

- Tailwind
- HTML
- Flex containers

### What I learned

I learned more about making custom shadows, and importing them into tailwind. I also learned about tailwind's outline class. 

### Continued development

If I were to continue working on this component, I would likely add more hover effects to the categories section. I would also make it so hovering over text does not make the cursor an "I" shape because the purpose is to click on the article.
